# RaidSummonPlus

## How it works:
You are in a RAID group  
Someone types 123 in /ra or /s or /y  
Playername gets added to the small RaidSummonPlus frame and is synced accros all RaidSummonPlus users  
SHIFT + leftclick to move the frame  
If a player is on the list the frame is visible (type /rsp to show/hide it manually)  
Left click to summon and remove (synced)  
Control Left click to just target the player  
Right click to remove (synced)  

If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /rsp to show/hide it manually)  

Options:  
/rsp help  
/rsp zone(enabled/disables zoneinfo in /w and /ra)  
/rsp whispers (enabled/disables whispering the target)  

## Compatibility:
For users coming from RaidSummon, the old commands (/rs, /raidsummon) still work!

## 1.1.0 Updates:
Class Colors are now used in the List  
Warlocks are always on top of the list  
Checks if player and target are in combat
